# What is RDFJS?

[RDFJS](https://github.com/rdfjs) is a [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) community group interested in both linked data and the Javascript language.
This specification (a technical standard) sets a common ground for the low level representation of RDF in Javascript. The valuable outcomes of the effort are:

- **interoperability**: develpers implementing their own libraries can be confident about compatibility with other libraries.
- **innovation**: the intersection between JS and linked data can possibly lead advances in society.
- **dissemination**: spreading the word about linked data in the Javascript community (and *vice versa*).
- **community building**: many skilled web developers are working on this as a group.

From a practical point of view the spec is about how to deal in JS with the basic components of linked data (Terms, Triple, Quad) and with a set of abstractions to manipulate them (Store, Stream). This primer intends to speed up your understanding of the spec with a set of examples. Before reading this you should be familiar with both linked data ([fast tutorial](http://pieroit.org/portfolio/linked-data-grandma/), [deep tutorial](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/)) and [Javascript](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/).We will build a graph about XXXXX
